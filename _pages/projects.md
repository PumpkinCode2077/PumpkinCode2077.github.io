## Cloud-based Crowd-sourced Mapping for Mass-produced Models
In the field of autonomous driving mapping, in addition to the traditional high-precision (HD) maps and real-time mapping that relies entirely on perception, a mainstream method is crowd-sourced mapping. By uploading the perception results of the vehicle side, multiple trips and a large amount of data are collected in the cloud for automatic aggregation to achieve a crowd-sourced map with high accuracy, low cost, and high freshness. Crowd-sourced maps can well assist downstream planning and control modules in autonomous driving.

Our solution leverages the MapTR V2 model as a baseline for improvement. This trained model is adept at identifying ground elements, such as lane markings. Within the cloud module, my responsibilities include developing the incremental fitting module with multi-frame perception, the matching module of perception map and base maps, the variation detection module, and the automatic fusion module. Each of these modules plays a crucial role in our solution, contributing to its overall effectiveness.

Among them, I designed a complete set of map evaluation and fusion system based on base map matching. This system can segment the new perception results based on the historical information of the base map and calculate the absolute mean error (MAE) and the mean relative error (MRE) of the lines to measure the perception quality. The detection result will be used as the input of map fusion, vital in determining the fusion confidence.

The variation results shown above are obtained from real experiments in Guangzhou's downtown. The scenario shows a complicated intersection mixing highway and city road. The right-hand side result is the fusion result achieved by automatic fusion and manual validation.

## Hybrid A* Application in HD Map Intersection's U-turn Line Generation






Generating a driveable U-turn curve with precise curvature constraints while ensuring the vehicle remains within
lane boundaries is crucial for safety. This study proposes an approach using a search-based planning algorithm combined with a non-holonomic vehicle motion model. Hybridizing the Ackermann-drive motion model into the A* plannerâ€™s expansion step enables the retention of optimality, and ensures safety and comfort constraints.
